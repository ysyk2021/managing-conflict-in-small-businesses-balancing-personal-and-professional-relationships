# Analyzing Results and Making Improvements

This chapter focuses on analyzing the results of conflict management strategies and making improvements based on the findings. Effectively evaluating the outcomes of conflict management efforts allows small businesses to refine their approaches, address any shortcomings, and enhance their conflict resolution practices. Here, we explore the key steps involved in analyzing results and making necessary improvements.

## 1\. Reviewing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

To initiate the analysis process, revisit the established Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to conflict management. Review the data collected and assess how well the small business has performed against the targets set for each KPI. Identify patterns, trends, and any significant deviations from the expected outcomes. This review will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of implemented conflict management strategies.

## 2\. Identifying Successes and Challenges

Analyzing results involves identifying both successes and challenges encountered during the conflict management process. Recognize and celebrate the achievements and positive outcomes that have occurred as a result of effective conflict resolution. At the same time, identify areas where conflicts persist or where conflict management strategies have not yielded the desired outcomes. This step helps in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the current approach.

## 3\. Seeking Feedback

Obtaining feedback from all relevant stakeholders is crucial to gain a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of conflict management strategies. Conduct surveys or interviews to gather input from employees, managers, and any other individuals involved in conflict resolution processes. Encourage honest and constructive feedback, allowing respondents to share their experiences, suggestions, and concerns regarding conflict management in the small business. This feedback serves as a valuable source of information for making improvements.

## 4\. Analyzing Root Causes

Identify the underlying factors contributing to conflicts and their persistence within the small business. Analyze the root causes to gain deeper insights into the sources of conflict and determine if there are any common themes or recurring issues. This analysis helps in understanding the specific areas that require improvement and guides the development of targeted strategies to address the root causes.

## 5\. Exploring Alternative Approaches

Once the causes of conflicts are identified, explore alternative approaches to conflict management. Research and consider different techniques, methodologies, or best practices that could be applicable to the small business. Consult with experts or seek external resources, such as books or seminars, to gain additional insights. Emphasize proactive conflict prevention strategies while also improving resolution techniques. Consider incorporating training programs or workshops to enhance employees' conflict management skills.

## 6\. Developing Action Plans

Based on the analysis of results, successes, challenges, feedback, and alternative approaches, develop action plans for making improvements. Set clear objectives and outline specific steps and timelines for implementing the necessary changes. Assign responsibilities to individuals or teams who will be responsible for executing the action plans. Ensure that the action plans align with the overall objectives of conflict management and the specific needs of the small business.

## 7\. Implementing Improvements

Efficiently implement the action plans and improvements identified in the previous step. Communicate the changes to all stakeholders involved in conflict management, ensuring they understand the rationale behind the modifications and their respective roles. Provide any necessary training or support to employees to facilitate the implementation process. Monitor progress closely and adjust strategies as needed throughout the implementation phase.

## 8\. Evaluating and Adapting

Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented improvements. Monitor KPIs, collect data, and seek feedback to measure the impact of the changes. Assess whether the modifications have led to positive outcomes, resolved conflicts more effectively, and improved overall conflict management within the small business. Identify any further adjustments or adaptations required based on the ongoing evaluation, and repeat the cycle of analysis, improvement, and evaluation as necessary.

## Conclusion

Analyzing the results of conflict management strategies is a crucial step in the process of improving conflict resolution practices in small businesses. By reviewing KPIs, identifying successes and challenges, seeking feedback, analyzing root causes, exploring alternative approaches, developing action plans, implementing improvements, and continuously evaluating and adapting, small businesses can refine their conflict management techniques. This iterative process enhances conflict resolution capabilities, fosters healthier relationships, and contributes to a more harmonious work environment, ultimately driving productivity and success.

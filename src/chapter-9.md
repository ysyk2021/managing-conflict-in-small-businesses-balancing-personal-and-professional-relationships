In some cases, conflicts in small businesses may be too complex or emotionally charged to resolve with internal conflict management strategies. In these situations, involving a third party can be an effective approach for resolving conflicts. Mediation is a commonly used technique that involves a neutral third party facilitating communication and negotiation between conflicting parties. In this chapter, we will explore techniques for mediation and third-party involvement.

Techniques for Mediation and Third-Party Involvement
----------------------------------------------------

1. Active Listening: Mediators must be skilled at active listening to fully understand the perspectives and concerns of each party involved in the conflict.

2. Neutral Position: Mediators must maintain a neutral position and avoid taking sides or showing bias towards either party.

3. Reframing: Mediators may reframe statements made by one party to ensure that the other party fully understands their perspective.

4. Brainstorming: Mediators may encourage both parties to brainstorm potential solutions together in order to find a mutually beneficial resolution.

Understanding the Role of Mediation
-----------------------------------

Mediation is a voluntary process in which a trained mediator helps parties in conflict communicate more effectively, understand each other's perspectives, and reach a mutually acceptable agreement. The mediator does not make decisions for the parties but instead facilitates communication and negotiation to help them reach their own agreement.

Identifying When to Involve a Third Party
-----------------------------------------

Signs that a third party may be needed include stalemate, emotionally charged conflict, power imbalances, and legal issues. Involving a neutral third party can provide benefits such as improved communication, cost-effectiveness, and preserving positive working relationships.
